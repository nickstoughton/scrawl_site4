<h2>FACEBOOK'S COOL...BUT IT'S NOT PERFECT.</h2>
<h3>No ‘dislike' button:</h3> For that matter there’s no ‘whatever,’ ‘who cares,’ ‘poor baby,’ or ‘that sucks’ buttons.  But the real world isn't 'the land of the nice happy people' and if something sucks  I want to say so.
<p>
<h3>Crippled comments:</h3> You can only comment where FB lets you. If they put a little box on the page to comment or upload something...I can have my say.  If they haven't...tough.  But why can't I say what I want wherever I want?  Why can't I write on a photo?  Or lay some audio on a friend's status update?
</p>
<h2>SCRAWL POWERS UP FACEBOOK WITH...</h2>
<h3>Megabuttons:</h3> The buttons you always wanted: ‘dislike', ‘whatever’, ‘who cares’, ‘poor baby’ 
<p></p>
<h3>Powercomments:</h3> Say goodbye to little boxes.  Comment on whatever you like, wherever you like, however you like.  And share it with whoever you want.
